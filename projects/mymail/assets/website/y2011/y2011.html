			<h1>Summer Job</h1>

			<h2>May 11, 2011</h2>

			<hr>

			<p>
				Hi Anne,<br><br>

				Thank you for letting me work at your business last summer. As you know, I was hoping that I could again this coming summer. I understand that last year I just sort of asked you to do it informally; and I think that, in agreement with you, I should "apply" this time (in my parent's words).<br>
				I don't really have much planned this summer in terms of camp or anything. I'll be spending a lot of time at home. I think working at the letterpress would be a good opportunity for me, as it was last year. Not only is it better-spent free time for me, but hopefully, it's an extra pair of hands for you. I also would like to have this job for upcoming events; my Italian class will be going to Italy next year in April, and my parents said I have to pay for one third of the expense, roughly a thousand dollars.<br>
				I hope that in being hired by you and doing a more thorough and formal job this summer, I can prove to you and my parents that I am capable of contributing to more "adult" responsibilities. By saying, "doing a more thorough and formal job", I mean (among many things, like working harder, etc.) helping you to kick off your card line. I'm sorry that we never got around to it last year. As always, I have drawings (and paintings, if that's possible) that I made at LaGuardia this year that we can use. I also keep a personal sketchbook with a bunch of card-usable drawings. <br>
				Finally, I hope that if you do decide to hire me again, it's not because we're close family friends, or that I'm a kid or anything. If you decide to hire me, I hope that it's because you were content with my performance last year and that you actually want me to come back this time.<br><br>

				You can email or call me.

			<p>Hi Anne,<br><br>

			Sorry about the late response. I'm not really going to be doing much this summer. I'll be going away, but I don't know when. I can email you when I know for sure. I was thinking, when I'm in the city, I could work from like 10-3, Mon-Fri like last year? Let me know.</p>

			<p>Your annual check up is tomorrow in Tribecca at 5:45.  Do you want to come hear and hang and then we can go together?<br><br>

			Also, I really think you should get the Gardisil shot - I speak as a wise (old) woman and know you will most likely get the cancer-causing HPV virus at some point.  Please take it; you are fortunate they are offering it.<br><br>

			Please call my cell when you get this.<br><br>
				
			i love you,<br>
