				here is a lovely story for you:<br><br>

				My friends were at my house. One was smiling <img src="assets/images/smiling.gif"> and 2 was laughing <img src="assets/images/laughing.gif"> because I was trying to blow a bubble but i couldn't. <img src="assets/images/chewing.gif"> then friend no 1 started laughing really hard <img src="assets/images/laughinghard.gif" id="laughinghard">. friend no 3 is very polite and giggled slightly <img src="assets/images/giggle.gif" id="giggle">. friend no 4 was smirking. <img src="assets/images/smirking.gif"> friend no 5 was high. <img src="assets/images/upsidedown.gif"> we all got high except friend no 3 because she's a goody goody, but then she felt left out. it was okay though. <img src="assets/images/consolation.gif" id="consolation">So she got high too and it was funny. <img src="assets/images/moustache.gif" id="moustache"> When we all came down from our high. "OMG we have to do our hw!" Said 3. "Lets just say we 'forgot' to do it." said 4, winking. <img src="assets/images/winking.gif"> "we really should do it!" said 3. <img src="assets/images/scared.gif"> "actually," said 1, who was quite nerdy. <img src="assets/images/nerd.gif"> "it's a project but we really should do it, since it's a group project." "OH PHEW" said 3, who never missed a hw in her life. <img src="assets/images/phew.gif" id="phew"> "but i will forget about it tommorow from all the crack, so lets do it now." said 5. she was very high. <img src="assets/images/sad.gif"> then lets think, i said. so we did. <img src="assets/images/thinking.gif"> 5 was high so she was no use. <img src="assets/images/frazzled.gif"> we all thought hard, but couldn't think of anything to do for our project. <img src="assets/images/meh.gif"> it was mind boggling! <img src="assets/images/mindboggling.gif"> then 2 had an idea. she was a very cool person. <img src="assets/images/cool.gif"> after she explained, 3 said it wouldn't work and got sad. <img src="assets/images/sadsad.gif"> then 5 passed out. <img src="assets/images/passedout.gif"> it was akward because she threw up on herself before she went out. <img src="assets/images/embarassed.gif" id="embarassed"> 3 freaked out!!!!!!!! "NOTHINGS GOING THE RIGHT WAY!!!! We'RE GONNA FAIL SKOOL AND GET ARRESTED FOR DRUG USE!!!!!!" she sobbed. <img src="assets/images/sobbing.gif" id="sobbing"> "er im sure we can think of Something!" i said, faking a smile. <img src="assets/images/fakesmile.gif"> 3 stopped crying but was still quite sad. <img src="assets/images/sad03.gif"> "OMG!!!!" said 2, who was stupid. <img src="assets/images/omg.gif" id="omg"> "I HAVE AN IDEA... WAIT NO I DONT" 5 was still passed out. <img src="assets/images/sleeping.gif"> "uhh i dont think that is gonna help us..." i said. <img src="assets/images/sweaty.gif" id="sweaty"> then mr. robot came. "I WILL DO UR HW FOR U" it said. <img src="assets/images/robot.gif" id="robot"> awesome! <img src="assets/images/tongue.gif"> we were all happy, <img src="assets/images/grinning.gif"> and we loved the robot<img src="assets/images/hearteyes.gif">. 3 got quite romantic and after she realised what she was doing she was embarrased. <img src="assets/images/blushing.gif"> then 5 woke up with a splitting headache and was quite angry. <img src="assets/images/angry.gif" id="angry"> i just rolled my  eyes. <img src="assets/images/eyeroll.gif"> 2 kept her mouth shut. <img src="assets/images/zippedlips.gif"> 5 was very quite evil. <img src="assets/images/devil.gif" id="devil"> so we decided to do our project on nature. more specifically: pigs <img src="assets/images/pig.gif" id="pig">, monkeys <img src="assets/images/monkey.gif" id="monkey">, and crabs <img src="assets/images/crab.gif" id="crab">. but we also did weather too, like sun<img src="assets/images/sun.gif">, clouds<img src="assets/images/clouds.gif">, rain<img src="assets/images/umbrella.gif">, and snow<img src="assets/images/snowman.gif">. after we were done we went outside and looked at the moon since it was nighttime<img src="assets/images/moon.gif">. there were lots of pretty flowers in my garden <img src="assets/images/redflower.gif"> <img src="assets/images/blueflower.gif">. "come one guys, lets go in, it's quite dark" <img src="assets/images/house.gif"> said wimpy 3. we started taking lots of pictures <img src="assets/images/camera.gif"> because it was 5's birthday<img src="assets/images/present.gif">. she loved wild parties, so we invited everyone over by the phone <img src="assets/images/cellphone.gif"> , and fb<img src="assets/images/computer.gif">. as a present, we all went on vacation<img src="assets/images/suitcase.gif">. while we were there, we played sports<img src="assets/images/baseball.gif">, and rode in rental cars <img src="assets/images/car.gif">. we also did karaoke<img src="assets/images/microphone.gif">, and starred in a movie<img src="assets/images/moviecamera.gif">, and danced to music all night<img src="assets/images/musicnote01.gif"><img src="assets/images/musicnote02.gif">. when we were tired and went back to our hotel, we relaxed and watched tv<img src="assets/images/tv.gif"> and listended to the local radio<img src="assets/images/radio.gif">. during dinner, when the bell rang<img src="assets/images/bell.gif">, we ate sweets like cake<img src="assets/images/cake.gif"><img src="assets/images/cutlery.gif">. it was delicious follwed up by a cup of coffee<img src="assets/images/coffee.gif">. then we got drunk<img src="assets/images/martini.gif">.  and to bring down our hangovers by drinking tea <img src="assets/images/tea.gif">. when you're high and drunk everything is ver confusing and weird<img src="assets/images/punctuation01.gif"><img src="assets/images/punctuation02.gif"><img src="assets/images/punctuation03.gif"><img src="assets/images/punctuation04.gif"> we fell in love<img src="assets/images/heart.gif">, and broke our lover's hearts<img src="assets/images/brokenheart.gif">. when you're high, everything is better than it seems<img src="assets/images/lightbulb.gif"><img src="assets/images/sparkles.gif"><img src="assets/images/star.gif"> but you will always come crashing down<img src="assets/images/poop.gif" id="poop">.

On their next date they go out for <img src="assets/images/burger.gif"><img src="assets/images/silverware.gif">, <img src="assets/images/icecream.gif">, and <img src="assets/images/martini.gif"> . Then they when out for <img src="assets/images/coffee.gif"> and the <img src="assets/images/whale02.gif"> gave her some <img src="assets/images/bouquet.gif">. Over the <img src="assets/images/telephone.gif">, the <img src="assets/images/whale.gif"> asked the <img src="assets/images/ghost02.png"> to be his <img src="assets/images/bride.gif">. The <img src="assets/images/ghost03.gif"> said "I <img src="assets/images/couple.gif"> you, but I am <img src="assets/images/pill.gif"> addict." and the whale <img src="assets/images/speechbubble.gif"> "I <img src="assets/images/sparklyheart.gif"> you just the way you are." And so they got married (<img src="assets/images/party03.gif">) on a <img src="assets/images/sailboat.gif"> and it was all very <img src="assets/images/anchor.gif">. And then they ate <img src="assets/images/poop.gif"> and lived <img src="assets/images/laughinghard.gif"> ever after.
